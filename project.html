          <p class="lead">
            MARK 1 marked the inception of Team Humanoid. This rudimentary
            bipedal robot was powered and controlled by ARDUINO UNO with 4 servo
            motors. The model walked by determining angles via trial and error
            methods, however the motion wasn’t perfect. Analysis made us realize
            that another set of servos was required for an improved walk and a
            more flexible alternate of the wooden structure was essential for
            the proper joint rotation.

            Mark 2 is the ameliorated, enhanced and superior version of Mark 1.
            This steel structured, lead acid battery powered and Arduino MEGA
            controlled robot walked with higher efficacy and simpler algorithm
            possessing a set of ankle motors. Initially, the servos didn’t
            respond as per the expectations, following which the power supply
            design system was detected with certain problems. To mitigate these,
            a central power supply design board was made that controlled the
            Arduino power as well. Yet, the system, did not maintain proper
            balance by itself due to insufficient length of the bot and hence
            the bot length was increased.

            After gaining experience from MARK-I & II the team now decided to
            work on with “Smart Servos”, a set of more powerful motors and
            that’s how Mark-3 came into existence. Following the Cad model
            approval, Mark 3 was created using Aluminum steel, Dynamixel (high
            precise motor) and a central power supply (controller for motors)
            which stood as high as 88.5cm. The control engineers calculated all
            the angles following which the coding team worked on those angles
            and the perfect humanoid walk was achieved. But without the sensors
            calibration was difficult, also we realized that the ankle design
            has to be much better and more like the human ankle.

            the servos accordingly to shoot them using a gun. The angles of
            rotation of the motors are determined by using inverse kinematics
            and Vector Algebra. The system is currently implemented on a 45cm
            Humanoid as a proof of concept. The robot can shoot moving targets
            by predicting their position by calculating the acceleration and
            velocity. We are currently working on implementing Machine learning
